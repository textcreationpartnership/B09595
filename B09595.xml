            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A NEW YEARS GIFT TO HIS MAJESTIE, On His Gracious DECLARATION FOR Liberty of Conscience.</head>
            <l>AS when of Old, the God-head was invoked</l>
            <l>By Sacrifice, and reeking Temples smoked.</l>
            <l>When the Crown'd Victory did on Altars lie,</l>
            <l>And Odours mounted to Perfume the Skie.</l>
            <l>We pay'd Heav'n Off'rings in the Blood we pour'd,</l>
            <l>But from those Blessings, which it self had show'rd;</l>
            <l>The Rams, the Bulls, and Lambs, were but a Feast,</l>
            <l>From Heav'ns own Plenty, which our Earth had Bless'd:</l>
            <l>Incense and Fragrant Gums, alas, no more</l>
            <l>Than what their own kind Sun had sent before.</l>
            <l>As then to Heaven, to Heav'ns <hi>Vicegerent</hi> now,</l>
            <l>With the same thankful Gratitude we bow.</l>
            <l>The Zeal which does our Loyal Bosoms Fire,</l>
            <l>Is but that warmth which his own Beams inspire.</l>
            <l>Our Joys the Seeds his Clemency has sown,</l>
            <l>Whil'st all the Mighty Harvest is his own.</l>
            <l>Three New Born Years, with all the Rich increase,</l>
            <l>Of lasting Happiness, and flowing Peace</l>
            <l>Have run their shining Empiraean round;</l>
            <l>Since fair <hi>Astrea</hi> in Great <hi>JAMES</hi> was Crown'd:</l>
            <l>Monarch like <hi>JAMES,</hi> the Scepter never bore,</l>
            <l>All Hearts till now, were never charm'd before;</l>
            <l>Empire of late did partial Favours shour,</l>
            <l>Some felt the smiles, and some the Scourge of Power:</l>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:180635:2"/>
            <l>Religion then stood, Arm'd with Teeth and Claws,</l>
            <l>With all her sanguinan Tangs of Laws;</l>
            <l>Then Holy Zeal with haughty Pride was fill'd,</l>
            <l>And her Church-state with Chains and Jayls upheld,</l>
            <l>Full Gorged with Spoils, the Ravenous Wanton lay,</l>
            <l>And in her Tallons grasp'd the weaker Prey.</l>
            <l>This <hi>JAMES</hi> beheld, pittying the opprest,</l>
            <l>His sacred Goodness, warm'd his Royal Breast▪</l>
            <l>The Charm dissolved, Religions Tyrant Yoke,</l>
            <l>And all the Manacles of Conscience broke;</l>
            <l>Whilst Pride and Cruelty to Confusion hurl'd,</l>
            <l>He cut the Gordiann Knot to win the World.</l>
            <l>So in the Walls of Paradice of Old,</l>
            <l>One Fence the Leopard, and the Lamb could hold:</l>
            <l>Then Innocence ne're sigh'd, nor Weakness Groan'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Savage</hi> and <hi>Wild,</hi> were Names of the Infant World disown'd.</l>
            <l>Such Nature in her No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ge was, nor are</l>
            <l>The long-flown Golden Minutes fled so far;</l>
            <l>But Mighty <hi>JAMES</hi> resolved, sits down to Write</l>
            <l>Due Copys from th' Original so bright.</l>
            <l>The Strong and Weak, one Mutual Tye shall joyn,</l>
            <l>Sacred the Union, and the Bond Divine</l>
            <l>The Thorns no more, shall tender Foot-steps Gall;</l>
            <l>But his whole World, one Floury <hi>Eden</hi> all.</l>
            <l>Meet then the happy Senate of the Land,</l>
            <l>And the Great <hi>JAMES,</hi> his Duteous Champions stand.</l>
            <l>Joyn all your help to aid the Mighty Birth,</l>
            <l>And bring the Labouring Joves Minerva forth.</l>
            <l>Assist the Glorious Founders Hand, bring you</l>
            <l>The Comment, and the Rich Materials too;</l>
            <l>By which the great Imperial Architect,</l>
            <l>The Royal <hi>Fiat</hi> may that Pile Erect;</l>
            <l>Under whose Roof, your selves and Heirs may rest,</l>
            <l>With endless Peace, to endless Worlds possest.</l>
